// They enable interactions to be associated with their async work,
// And expose interaction metadata to the React DevTools Profiler plugin.
// Note that these attributes are only defined when the enableSchedulerTracing flag is enabled.


// Exported FiberRoot type includes all properties,
// To avoid requiring potentially error-prone :any casts throughout the project.
// Profiling properties are only safe to access in profiling builds (when enableSchedulerTracing is true).
// The types are defined separately within this file to ensure they stay in sync.
// (We don't have to use an inline :any cast when enableSchedulerTracing is disabled.)
